          <p>
            For the purposes of the provisions of the current regulations regarding the protection of data of a personal character, through this Privacy Policy, Amazonia Studio (hereinafter "AMS" or "the Operator") informs users (hereinafter "User" or "Users") of its games or applications (hereinafter "Service"), about its policy of protection of data of a personal character provided by Users who use our Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, Users may freely and voluntarily determine whether they wish to provide AMS with any personal data that may be required or obtained about them when accessing and using the Service. AMS is committed to protecting the privacy of its Users.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this sense, it is necessary for the User to know that, for the inscription and registration to the Services offered by the AMS, data of a personal nature will be requested. In the cases and with regard to the data so expressly requested from the User, if not provided, the User will not be able to access or use said Services and contents.
          </p>
          <p>
            In compliance with current regulations, AMS adopts the necessary technical and organizational measures to maintain the required level of security in relation to the personal data processed. Likewise, the Operator is equipped with the appropriate mechanisms within its reach to prevent, as far as possible, unauthorized access, theft, unlawful alterations and loss of data.
          </p>
          <p>
            The AMS will publish the version in force at any time on its website. To this end, AMS reserves the right to make, at any time, the changes, updates or modifications it deems appropriate under this Privacy Policy. If the User does not accept the new version of the Privacy Policy, AMS shall have the right to block his gaming account and cancel his data of a personal nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            The processing of the data collected and stored concerning Users is for the sole purpose of providing and improving the AMS Service, so that Users can enjoy the best possible entertainment in our games.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="text-uppercase  pt-5">Personal Data</h3>
          <p>
            The User authorizes the processing of his/her personal data in the terms provided below and acknowledges that the mere acceptance hereof authorizes the processing necessary for the provision of the Service.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Operator informs the User that the data that are informed for the creation of the User registration and the game account, as well as those collected subsequently, will be incorporated into a file of data of a personal nature owned by the Operator, the purpose of which is to enable access to the services offered by AMS, to manage, maintain and develop the Service to Users, as well as to improve, expand and adjust the Services offered according to the preferences and interests of Users.
          </p>
          <p>
            The type of personal data stored according to the Service differs according to the Service or application, and may include first and last name, social network to which you belong, the UDID (unique identifier of your device), purchase transaction identifiers, associated email, social network profile picture to which you belong or any other type of information related to and included in the social network, profile or online application.
          </p>

            In addition, AMS may acquire information from you through accessing and participating in forums, blogs and chat rooms on a Service or application, the content of inquiries made to the support service or the purchase of a virtual product of any kind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that because the management of virtual goods purchases offered by the Service or App is performed by a third party, AMS does not have access to your credit card data or billing information.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="text-uppercase  pt-5">Non-personal data</h3>
          <p>
            Non-personal data refers to a series of data that, if collected in statistical form, cannot be used to identify or contact you. AMS may store non-personal information about your use of the Service, both during the course of play and when using the software. AMS may also invite you to share non-personal information about you, such as: your age and/or date of birth, gender, data regarding the software you use, platform, mobile operating system, mobile platform, etc., information related to your favorite websites, Facebook "likes", interest groups, fan pages, etc, any type of information included in a Facebook request, duration of game sessions, record of highest scores, language, zip code and code of your region or area, location and time zone, compilation of data on incidents, type of internet connection and the browser used, referring, exit, destination and URL pages, as well as the time and date of your activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            All kinds of data compilation is geared towards enabling the AMS to improve its applications and Service through knowledge of User behavior.
          </p>
          <p>
            If non-personal data is collected for some type of activity that requires the use of personal data, AMS may combine the use of AMS both types of data in order to provide a better Service, the purpose of which is to provide more entertainment to the User's experience and the supposed improvement of the Service, as well as the performance of a statistical analysis of our services for the storage and management of the data directly provided by the User.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="text-uppercase  pt-5">Como o AMS utiliza seus dados pessoais</h3>
          <p>
            AMS uses the stored information to improve the User's experience, analyze their preferences and send purchase requests through their account, contact them to offer new products, inform them of the aspects and features of our games, promotions, possibilities of updating the Service or any type of information regarding the same that may be of interest to the User.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, you acknowledge that AMS makes use of tools provided by the different social networks, such as a friend finder that you have used, to allow your contacts to associate themselves with the Service and the elements related to it, such as the games played, wins or pertinent applications, being subject to this privacy policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you use a referral or sponsorship service to invite a friend to try our Service, AMS may ask for your friend's name and email address, and through that means will send him or her an email or text message on your behalf so that he or she can try the Service in question. AMS will store such data for a short term only, for the sole purpose of inviting your friend to use the Service and to ensure that you do not receive repeat invitations of the product. AMS will not store such information permanently at any time.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you participate in any sweepstakes, contest or similar, AMS may use the information provided to administer said entries. In addition, participation in any type of online tournament or championship is conditioned upon AMS granting permission to manage and use the data provided by you statistically to publicly disclose how Users' scores, overall rankings, winnings or prizes derived from your performance may be.
          </p>
          <p>
            By accepting rewards from the AMS Services, you are irrevocably consenting for AMS to use your username or first name used on the network for advertising and promotional purposes without any additional compensation.
          </p>
          <p>

            Notwithstanding, the User may carry out the exercise of its rights of access, rectification and opposition via e-mail forwarded to info@amazoniastudio.com
          </p>
          <p>
            It should be noted that there are cases in which AMS is legally obliged to keep your information if so required by the competent authority. AMS reserves the right to fully cooperate to ensure compliance with laws as required by the authorities, including cooperating in the investigation of reports of unlawful activities.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="text-uppercase  pt-5">Disclosure of information to members and providers</h3>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
            Your personal information will only be disclosed to third parties outside of AMS in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. AMS is committed to taking the necessary steps to ensure that our arrangements with third parties protect your privacy by ensuring that those third parties strictly comply with our guidelines.
          </p>
